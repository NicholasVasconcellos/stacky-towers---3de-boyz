# Block O'Clock 3D

## Description of the Project

Our project is a unique take on local multiplayer games that combines falling block puzzles with action platforming in a shared 3D arena. Players rush to collect "Tetris-like" blocks raining from above and race to construct the tallest tower before time runs out, or be the first one to reach the goal. Physics-based forces apply to the blocks, introducing puzzle and strategy elements. Furthermore, action platformer mechanics emerge through two key challenges: racing opponents to collect blocks and traversing towers to find ideal placements.

This project aims to help invigorate the local multiplayer, party games, genre and bring people together. Many modern multiplayer games are now online-only, while this allows for connecting with those who are far away, it also doesn't encourage face-to-face interaction, which serves to build deeper connections and cannot simply be replaced with online interactions. Additionally, the game's physics-based stacking system offers educational value alongside entertainment. Players intuitively engage with STEM concepts such as equilibrium and structural stability as they place blocks, explore geometric properties through varied 3D shapes, and gain practical exposure to physics engine mechanics that govern the gameplay.
